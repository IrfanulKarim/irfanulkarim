                                                Each company I worked with I started with focusing on finding Why, How, and What. For companies and products like Real Acquisitions, iDream, Merchaint, Drive Good, Vutal, Routii, Slikekspressen, Solactivy, and others, I conducted in-depth company analysis to understand the core purpose and why the company exists. I thoroughly examined customer personas, mapped out key use cases, and evaluated whether the business model aligned with B2B, B2C, or B2B2C frameworks. I assessed product quality by measuring actionable metrics, including vanity metrics and NPS, to determine strengths and areas for improvement. I also developed strategic roadmaps while conducting competitive and climate analysis. To provide a comprehensive view, I employed the 5C framework (Company, Customers, Competitors, Collaborators, and Climate), ensuring a deep understanding of each business.

These outputs helped guide strategic decisions and optimize business growth. -->

                                                    For companies and products like Real Acquisitions, iDream, Merchaint, Drive Good, Vutal, Routii, Slikekspressen, Solactivy and more, I focused on finding cost-effective ways to validate product ideas and opportunities. This involved conducting thorough cost/benefit analyses, customer development through interviews and surveys, and performing SWOT analyses. I facilitated internal validation sessions with teams and ran experiments using A/B testing. To test ideas quickly and efficiently, I built MVPs, including preorders, concierge services, Wizard of Oz, and fake door experiments. Additionally, I conducted litmus tests to gauge market readiness and applied frameworks such as the Kano model to evaluate value versus cost. These steps were integral to identifying opportunities and shaping successful product strategies.

These deliverables helped inform strategic decisions and drive product success. -->

                                                        For companies and products such as Real Acquisitions, Flowcite, Leekim, Monezsoft, iDream, Merchaint, Drive Good, Vutal, Routii, Slikekspressen, Solactivy, and others, I played a key role in taking product ideas from initial vision to execution. I began by crafting internal future press releases to establish a shared vision for the product. Then, I defined the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to focus on the core functionalities and test product viability early on. A critical part of the process was creating and communicating through comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs). These PRDs included an overview and objectives, success metrics, messaging, release timelines, user personas, scenarios, storytelling, and detailed feature lists. They also addressed design elements, open issues, and considerations. I ensured that the PRD became the central reference for guiding development, aligning cross-functional teams, and ensuring the product met both business goals and user needs <br>

                                                        Key deliverables included well-structured internal future press releases, MVP definitions, and detailed Product Requirements Documents (PRDs). Each PRD contained the product overview, objectives, success metrics, messaging, timelines, personas, user scenarios, feature inclusions and exclusions, designs, and open issues. These deliverables enabled teams to execute on the product vision with clarity and focus. -->

I worked closely with design teams throughout usability testing, using prototypes to gather feedback and refine the user experience. My role involved providing constructive feedback on designs, ensuring that the product vision translated well into the user interface. I followed structured design sprints, helping prepare and guide teams through each phase—understanding user needs, defining problems, exploring divergent solutions, deciding on the best approaches, building prototypes, and conducting user testing. This iterative process ensured that the design was user-centric, functional, and aligned with the overall product strategy.                                                    <br>

These helped refine design decisions, improve product usability, and ensure successful collaboration between product and design teams. -->

I enhanced SOPs, workflows, and processes, ensuring an Agile mindset across teams and promoting continuous development to achieve project goals. I prepared detailed user stories with acceptance criteria and collaborated with the team on Definition of Done (DOD) and Definition of Ready (DOR). By encouraging self-organization and self-motivation, I helped teams maintain transparency to identify and adapt to challenges quickly. I facilitated Scrum ceremonies and served the team by resolving conflicts, ensuring smooth collaboration with cross-functional teams, and working with remote and third-party development teams. I conducted acceptance testing when necessary, mitigated risks with proper planning, and avoided micromanagement through Lean thinking. Additionally, I generated performance reports to track both product and team progress.                                                        <br>

                                                    For companies and products such as Real Acquisitions, Monezsoft, Merchaint, Drive Good, Routii, Slikekspressen, Solactivy, and more, I played a pivotal role in bringing products to market through close collaboration with cross-functional teams. I started by deeply understanding customer needs and defining the company’s voice and product messaging. I developed comprehensive go-to-market (GTM) strategies, focusing on pre-launch planning, setting clear launch objectives, and ensuring the right timing for maximum impact. I worked with teams to plan and test launch assets, using a structured pre-launch marketing framework to ensure readiness. Throughout the launch process, I coordinated all activities, from launch execution to post-launch analysis. Additionally, I monitored the entire customer life cycle and measured marketing costs to optimize the product’s market performance.                                                    <br>

                                                    Key deliverables included GTM strategies, pre-launch plans, launch objectives and timelines, testing reports, marketing asset plans, customer life cycle analysis, and post-launch performance reviews. These deliverables ensured a smooth, well-coordinated product launch and successful market entry.                                                </p> -->

After each product phase, I ensured we celebrated the team’s efforts and values, recognizing achievements and motivating continued success. Retrospectives were a key practice, where we assessed how things went and identified areas for improvement. This allowed us to adapt and recommend actionable improvements for future iterations. By focusing on continuous reflection and adaptation, I helped the team maintain momentum and continue building exceptional products that evolve with market needs.                                                <br>
