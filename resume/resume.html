												At Tikweb, one of my notable achievements was the development of SlikEkspressen, a Denmark-based product with a Shopify site, consisting of three mobile apps and two full systems related to candy sales. This product has achieved significant success, ranking 9th in the food and beverage section of the Danish app store. Here‚Äôs what I accomplished:<br><br>

													<ul>
														<li>In September 2023, during one of the weeks, our B2C turnover was 47% higher than the previous week and 74% higher than the same week in 2022.</li>
														<li>I was part of a growth team based in Denmark, where I contributed to business expansion efforts.</li>
														<li>As a Scrum Master, I helped the team adopt an Agile mindset, resolve conflicts, meet commitments, and achieve sprint goals.</li>
														<li>By implementing Agile practices and facilitating Scrum ceremonies, I enhanced team productivity and removed impediments to progress.</li>
														<li>Additionally, in collaboration with the Product Owner, I actively participated in product backlog grooming with the client and made data-driven decisions to improve product features and user experience.</li>
														<li>I conducted Agile tests to ensure that user stories met the acceptance criteria.</li>
														<li>I created resource and budget plans according to the project's financial constraints.</li>

                                                        At Tikweb, I have been working with the Vutal team since its inception. Here, I served as the Scrum Master, collaborating closely with the Product Owner and helping the team manage the product development process.<br><br>
														The Product Owner, who was also a key stakeholder, had limited availability, so I stepped in to support and guide him. Key contributions include:<br>
														<ul>
															<li>Together with the team, I analyzed the problems they aimed to solve for users and identified scalable solutions. Then, I led requirement meetings with stakeholders, discussing the product, the problems to be addressed, and their business goals.</li>
															<li>We defined the minimum viable features for the product, after which I created a feature list and prepared the product backlog with the team.</li>
															<li>I collaborated with the Product Owner to groom and refine the backlog.</li>
															<li>I documented the product and educated the Product Owner about our processes.</li>
															<li>I communicated the use case requirements to the product designer and assisted in creating prototypes.</li>
															<li>I helped the Product Owner draft epics and user stories for the team. I worked closely with the team to refine epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria, and I created user flow diagrams to ensure the team understood the stories clearly.</li>
															<li>I enforced the Definition of Ready (DOR) and Definition of Done (DOD) to maintain transparency and clarity in requirements.</li>
															<li>We shared the roadmap with stakeholders and developed release plans, obtaining their confirmation at every stage.</li>
														</ul>
														
														Additionally, I facilitated key Scrum events, including sprint backlog grooming, sprint planning, daily Scrum, backlog refinement, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives. I also resolved blockages and impediments, encouraging the team to be self-organized and self-motivated.<br>
														In August 2023, we successfully released version 1.0.0 of the product.

                                                    It was one of my teams from Tikweb:<br>

													<ul>
														<li>Implemented Scrumban, Kanban, and Scrum according to the team's needs.</li>
														<li>Facilitated collaboration between the Salesforce team and the Dev team, ensuring smooth cross-platform coordination.</li>
														<li>Worked with 5-7 teams to deliver value and ensure no blockages.</li>
													</ul>
													

													Sharing one of the conflict experiences from Salient, where I worked with 3 teams: the Salesforce team, the Backend team, and the Mobile team. It was often that the SF team and the backend team had conflicts related to API development. The main issue was that the backend team wasn't developing the API according to the SF team's requirements. Here's how I handled it:<br><br>

													<ul>
														<li>I conducted 1:1 meetings with each team member.</li>
														<li>Performed a root cause analysis.</li>
														<li>Discovered that the root cause was unclear requirements, so I established a simple communication channel to ensure everyone was on the same page, promoting transparency.</li>
														<li>I asked the SF team to prepare a sample JSON format to clearly express their requirements. This allowed the backend team to develop the API following the desired format.</li>
														<li>These steps helped reduce confusion and conflicts between both teams.</li>
													</ul>

											</header>
											<p>
                                                The first team I started with at Tikweb was Routii, a mobile app for tourists and travelers. Phase 1 was struggling with poor UX and limited features.<br>

												<ul>
													<li>As a Scrum Master, I discovered that the Product Owner lacked experience, so I conducted market and competitive analyses to better understand the real issues.</li>
													<li>I gathered data and worked with the team to analyze it and create a plan for Phase 2.</li>
													<li>I learned more about the users through both user and client feedback. Using this data, I built User Stories and User Flows to guide the team.</li>
													<li>Together with the Product Owner and team, we created the product backlog. From Product Backlog Refinement to Sprint Backlog Refinement, Sprint Planning, Scrum, Sprint Meetings, Reviews, and Retrospectives, we continued the work in this structured way.</li>
												</ul>
